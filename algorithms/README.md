> Write a function that computes the hamming distance between two iterables. The hamming distance is defined as the number of positions where the symbols are different. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance>

##### Solution

[See solution](./hamming_distance.py)

> Uniquely Encode a string to as short a length as possible then decode it. Feel free to look up established algorithms to attempt the shortest length possible, but cite the algorithm you have chosen. We will compare your compression against Run Length Encoding, listed next to each example is the length of the compressed string using Run Length Encoding.
